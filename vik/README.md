# Primis Dataset

This documents the trials on primis dataset using pytorch, version 0.3.

Here is a table of accuracies achieved thus far, and todo items:


TODO List

- [ ] Use a learning rate with decay
- [ ] Run it on a GPU to assess speed, and to identify optimal batch size for
  max. utilisation.
- [ ] Visualise the accuracies, and saturation on matplotlib
- [ ] Visualise the CN layer outputs, and the ones with errors on the test set.
